        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In recent years cleanliness is becoming an <u>important factor</u>  for the betterment of the nation Effective cleaning and sanitizing helps and <b>protect the health</b> of the human beings directly and indirectly. It also improves the shelf life of the floor, walls etc due to regular cleaning and maintenance Vacuum cleaner is widely applied to eliminate spills at homely levels, but might fail to remove non flying metal spills, as it damages the tube of vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> There is no one single cleaning method that is suitable for all locations and occasions and effective cleaning depends upon type of cleaning device, cleaning technique and also the equipment should be user friendly. So far, people are no longer satisfied that road cleaning vehicles only perform single cleaning task. In this project it is aimed to cover over <b><big>metal particle</big></b> and <b><big>solid waste</big></b> to collect waste as well as <u>separate</u> the waste in same period of time </li>
            <li> And to perform both smooth and rough surfaces like <i><big>mud, wood, concrete, marbles, roads etc</big></i>  According to find the best cleaning brush for that particular surface, repeating cleaning process is occur In this work,easily available materials with <b>low cost</b> is used and it can be easily fabricated and <b>easy to control</b>. It is the better alternative for conventional machine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FABRICATION</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The machine uses two separate rods, in this one is connected
                at the front of the machine and another one is connected at the
                back of the machine ,the rod one connected which is
                below having magnetic roller which having a function to
                <b>collect metal waste</b> and chips The magnetic chip collector consists of a set of permanent
                magnets arranged axially utilizing a shaft. The shaft has gears on front side of the wheel These gears are
                meshed together which are arranged coaxially to shafts</li>
            <li>The rollers also have bearings for ease of rotation on
                which the belt moves and the bearings are supported by
                metal blocks which in turn welded to frame. The collector is designed as <big>rectangular in shape</big> 
                made up of aluminum metal sheet that fit metal frame The
                collector is also designed which can be <b>easily removed</b> after
                filling and placed again, when it is empty</li>
            <li>In another rod the roller brush is connected with help
                of bearing and it rotates with the help of pulley drive
                Two rolling brush setup is used for <b><big>dust cleaner concept</big></b>
                which consists of bearnings roller brush and rod And also
                dust collector is placed behind the brush to store the wastes
                The whole assembley is attached to the main frame which
                consists of handle to drive the vehicle</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>WORKING</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In this project, it is attempted design and fabricate the <b><big>manual
                operated sweeper</big></b>  with the help of chain drive. When the base frame is moved with the help of handle, the
                rear wheel will be rotated.
                The rotating wheels are connected to chain drive Chain
                drive is a way of transmitting <b>mechanical power</b> from one
                place to another.
                It passing over a sprocket gear,with the teeth of the gear
                meshing with the holes in the links of the chain</li>
            <li>So that the chain drive connected with it will be rotated
                which will rotate the rear wheel.
                Simple gear mechanism encompose the magnetic roller to
                <b>rotate reverse direction</b>.
                It attracts the ferrous chip and it is carried out on the
                conveyor belt It is arranged inbetween the roller shaft and
                magnetic roller.
                A chip pass away from the magnetic roller,get <b><big>demagnetize</big></b>
                and falls in collector under the influence of gravity.</li>
            <li>On other hand, the roller brush also has a pair of collector
                box used to sweep the waste and <u>automatically stored in the
                    collector box</u> is made up of aluminium sheet with the help of
                manual power</li>
            <li>Particularly in dust cleaning concepts, it is designed to change
                the brush setup For example, nylon brush to natural fibre
                brush Having two brush setup is designed to work different
                types of surface.
                Hence the sweeping brush and magnetic
                conveyor will be rotated which will help to collect the wastes
                over the area automatically.
                Both the collectors are filled with separate metal chips and
                dust particles are removed and make it empty for <i><big>repeating
                    process</big></i> .</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CONCLUSION </h3>

            <p style="margin-right: 4%;">The <i><big>design and experiment analysis of manually operated
                road cleaner with metal cleaner</big></i>  is successfully designed,
                analyzed and fabricated. 
                This project works implements road cleaning that reducing
                the cost, reduce the surface damage, human efforts as well as
                time. This cleaner solves the problem of dusty roads, floors and
                removal of metal particles from road, industrial surfaces etc
                It can be used on all kind of roads in rural as well as the
                urban. 
                This Road cleaner with metal collector will help to make
                <b>cleaner environment</b> and to overcome the issues of
                cleanliness in India</p>
