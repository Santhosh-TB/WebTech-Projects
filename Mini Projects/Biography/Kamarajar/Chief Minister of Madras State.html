        <p style="margin-top: 2%;">On <b>13 April 1954</b>, Kamaraj became the <big>Chief Minister of Madras Province</big>. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidambaram_Subramaniam" target="_blank">C. Subramaniam</a> , who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet.
        As Chief Minister, Kamaraj removed the family vocation based Modified Scheme of Elementary education 1953 introduced by Rajaji. He reopened <b><big><u>6000 schools</u></big></b> closed in the <small>previous government</small> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Rajagopalachari" target="_blank">C. Rajagopalachari</a> citing financial reasons and reopened <u>12,000 more schools</u>. The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, so that <i>poor rural students had to walk no more than three kilometres to their nearest school.</i></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2%;">Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing <b><big><i>free and compulsory education</i></big></b> up to the eleventh standard.He introduced the <b><big><u><i>Midday Meal Scheme</i></u></big></b> to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children. He introduced <big>free school uniforms</big> to weed out <small>caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds</small>.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2%;">During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj" target="_blank">colonial era</a> , the <u>local education rate was at 7%;</u> after Kamaraj's reforms, it <b><big>reached 37%</big></b>. Apart from increasing the number of schools, steps were taken to improve <i>standards of education</i>. To improve standards, the number of working days was increased from <big>180 to 200</big>; unnecessary holidays were reduced; and syllabi were prepared to give opportunity to various abilities. Kamaraj and Bishnuram Medhi (Governor) took efforts to <u>establish <big><b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a> in 1959</b></big></u>.</p>

        <p>Major irrigation schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. <big> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam" target="_blank">Dams</a> and irrigation canals</big> were built across higher <i>Bhavani, Mani Muthar, Aarani, Vaigai, Amaravathi, Sathanur, Krishnagiri, Pullambadi, Parambikulam and Neyyaru</i> among others. The <b>Lower Bhavani Dam</b> in Erode district brought <u>207,000 acres (840 km2)</u> of land under cultivation. <u>45,000 acres (180 km2)</u> of land benefited from canals constructed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mettur_Dam" target="_blank"><b>Mettur Dam</b></a> . The Vaigai and Sathanur systems facilitated cultivation across thousands of acres of lands in Madurai and North Arcot districts respectively. <big><b>Rs 30 crores</b></big> were planned to be spent for Parambikulam River scheme, and 150 lakhs of acres of lands were brought under cultivation; one third of this (i.e. 56 lakhs of acres of land) received a permanent irrigation facility. In <b>1957â€“61</b> <u>1,628 tanks</u> were de-silted under the Small Irrigation Scheme, and <u>2,000 wells</u> were dug with outlets. Long-term loans with 25% subsidy were given to farmers. In addition farmers who had dry lands were given <big><i><b>oil engines and electric pump</b></i></big> sets on an instalment basis.</p>

        </center>

        <p>Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Tamil_Nadu" target="_blank">three consecutive terms</a>, winning elections in 1957 and 1962. Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigour.On <b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_Jayanti" target="_blank">Gandhi Jayanti</a> day 2 October 1963,</b> he resigned from the post of the <big>Chief Minister</big>. He proposed that all <big>senior Congress leaders</big> should resign from their posts and devote all their energy to the <big><b><u>re-vitalization of the Congress</u></b></big>.</p>

        <p>In <big>1963</big> he suggested to Nehru that senior Congress leaders should leave ministerial posts to take up <b>organisational work</b>. This suggestion came to be known as the Kamaraj Plan, which was designed primarily to dispel from the minds of Congressmen the lure of power, creating in its place a dedicated attachment to the <u>objectives and policies</u> of the organisation. <big><b>Six Union Ministers and six Chief Ministers</b></big> including <i>Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai, Biju Patnaik and S.K. Patil</i> followed suit and <u>resigned</u> from their posts.</p>

        <p>Impressed by Kamaraj's achievements and acumen, <b>Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru</b> felt that his services were needed more at the national level. In a swift move he brought Kamaraj to Delhi as the <u>President of the <big>Indian National Congress</big></u>. Nehru realised that in addition to wide learning and vision, Kamaraj possessed enormous common sense and pragmatism. Kamaraj was elected the President of Indian National Congress on <i><b>9 October 1963.</b></i></p>

        </center>

        <p>After Nehru's death in <b>1964</b>, Kamaraj successfully navigated the party through turbulent times. As the president of INC, he <big><b>refused</b></big> to become the next <u>Prime Minister</u> himself and was instrumental in bringing to power two Prime Ministers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bahadur_Shastri" target="_blank"><big>Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1964</big></a> and Nehru's daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi" target="_blank"><big>Indira Gandhi 1966</big></a>.</p> 

        <p id="king" style="font-size: 25px;">For this role, he was widely acclaimed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingmaker" target="_blank"><big><b>"kingmaker"</b></big></a> during the 1960s.</p>

        <p>When the Congress <b>split in 1969</b>, Kamaraj became the <big>leader</big> of the <big><b>Indian National Congress (Organisation) (INC(O))</b></big> in Tamil Nadu. The party fared poorly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Indian_general_election" target="_blank">1971 elections</a> amid allegations of fraud by the opposition parties. He remained the leader of INC(O) until his <u>death in 1975</u>.</p>
