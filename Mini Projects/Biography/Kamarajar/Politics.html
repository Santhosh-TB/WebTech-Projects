Kamaraj developed an interest in <big>prevailing political conditions</big> by reading <b>newspapers daily</b>. The <i>"Jallianwala Bagh massacre"</i> was the decisive turning point in his life - he decided to fight for <u>national freedom and to bring an end to foreign rule</u>. In 1920, when he was 17, he became active in politics. He joined <b><big>Congress</big></b> as a full-time political worker. In 1921 Kamaraj organised <b>public meetings</b> at Virudhunagar for Congress leaders. He was eager to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target="_blank">"Mahatma Gandhi"</a>, and when Gandhi visited Madurai on <b><big><i>21 September 1921</i></big></b>, Kamaraj attended the public meeting and met Gandhi for the first time.
